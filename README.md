# macpu_assembler

A assembler of my MACPU

---

## About

In order to drive MACPU and make it have more application scenarios, we must implement a compiler of MACPU assembly language. In order to implement this compiler, I chose the high-performance and memory-safe rust language for development.

For the algorithm model of MACPU, please refer to [here](https://github.com/Abonite/MACPU-model); for the FPGA implementation of MACPU, please refer to [here](https://github.com/Abonite/MACPU-FPGA).

At present, this assembler only supports single-file compilation, that is, it does not have the link function for the time being.

## MACPU assembly syntax

### preprocessing command

Preprocessing commands are special commands used to set assembler properties, inform the assembler about the program, or provide developers with convenient development. Such commands start with a period "***.***", such as "***.SET***". They are preprocessed or recorded by the compiler before the compilation action begins.

In MACPU assembly language, the following preprocessing instructions are currently supported:

- **SET** - It is used to set the attributes of the assembler and program, such as "***.SET CODESTACKADDRESS hex1000***", this instruction can tell the assembler that the currently compiled assembler requires the start address of the code segment to be set to 1000 in hexadecimal
- **VAR** - This instruction is used to define a variable, such as "***.VAR LENTH 10***", this variable will be placed in the data segment, the specific offset address in the data segment will be automatically generated by the compiler, and it can be modified value, in subsequent programs, you can use it directly when you need to use the value "**LENTH**"
- **STR** - This command is used to define a character string, such as "***.STR NAME "ALAN TURING"***", this data will also be saved in the data segment, in this example, when the developer uses the variable "**NAME**", get The address of the first character of the entire string in memory is obtained, and the "**\0**" character representing the end of the string will be automatically added
- **ARR** - This instruction will create a continuous piece of data, just like an array in C language. Same as in C language, this instruction requires developers to ensure that the internal data must all be of the same type, like this: "***.ARR Byte MYDATA 0,1,2,3,4***", which will not affect development The follow-up operation of the personnel, because the processing and use of the array still needs to be written by the developer, but this will affect the behavior of the assembler, because different data types will occupy different lengths in memory, and the assembler will also Perform corresponding detection for the data type. Therefore, when using **ARR**, it is recommended that developers record the length of the array at the same time to prevent out-of-bounds. Same as "**STR**", when developers use "**MYDATA**", the program will get the location of the first value of this array in memory
- **DEF** - This instruction is the same as the macro definition in C language, and only provides the function of string replacement. This replacement will be performed after the precompilation command processing is completed and before the official compilation starts.

工作原理

1. 读取文件并将文件按行拆分，获得一个Vector，其中的每一个元素都是行字符串与行号的元组
2. 遍历所有以点号开头的行，并将其按照预处理指令的要求解析（DEFINE，DATA，ARRAY，SET），将有效的指令从Vector中删除，创建一个协程执行需要进行字符串替换的预处理指令（DEFINE，DATA，ARRAY），使用正则表达式。要求DEFINE指令被先处理，DATA次之，ARRAY再次。三种指令不能有重复的命名，不能以数字或引号开头，要对规则进行检查。处理DATA、ARRAY时，局应当同时生成数据端数组和记录变量的hashmap。在进行过DEFINE替换后，再将代码中的非DEFINE变量用hashmap替换
3. 获取SET指令的设置，并以此为基准进行后续操作
4. 按行读取指令，先获取所有的有效行数，并创建一个数组，每一个元素都是语法分析树。每读取一行就再给行标记一个连续的新标号，再以协程进行词法分析，词法分析应使用状态机逐个字符处理，拼接语法分析树，协程结束后按标号将语法分析树写入数组中。协程的返回值是result，将所有异常单独收集并统一列出
5. 如果所有协程都没有异常，则再开始读取语法分析树生成二进制数据，将它们写入预估好大小的数组，并记录标签的位置，所有涉及标签的指令都应该单独最后执行
